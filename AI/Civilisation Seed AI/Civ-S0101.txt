*******************************************************************************
* Civilisation Seed AI
* Release 0.101 - 30 January 2006, cEvo 0.14.X
*******************************************************************************

Brief Description:

Civ-S will attempt to win by either defeating all other nations or by completing the
transstellar colony ship, whichever comes first, in a stand-alone fashion (see below
note on Diplomacy).  Features include overseas attack, invasion and colonisation, and
use of sea-, air- and ground-based military forces.

Tested one on one against other AIs, on standard size maps - landmass 30% and 70%.

Change Log 0.101:

> various bug fixes [reported by users]
> concentrate research in the capital up to future gov. stage (inspired from Capital AI)
> improved empire expansion - grows markedly faster & wider than previous version
> builds early wonders significantly faster
> numerous other improvements/changes in handling units.

Thanks to those of you who bothered to send feedbacks of game crashes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on Diplomacy and (un)Cooperative Behaviour:

> CivS does never cooperate with other players
> CivS will never attempt to contact any other player
> when contacted CivS will accept to exchange basic information
> treaties are not evaluated and are automatically rejected
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy, and please send me the save files for games in which Civ-S crashed the
server or did something particularly silly.

I am looking forward to receiving your feedback.

TIP:

In case of a repeatable fatal crash and in order to continue your game you can
temporarily replace the defaulting AI by StdAI for instance. This should make
it possible to pass the crash bottleneck.

i.e. 0-crash occurs and is repeatable
     1-overwrite defaulting AI
     2-reload the ~saved game
     3-play 1 turn and save game
     4-restore defaulting AI
     5-reload game 

It would then be appreciated to send the crashed ~saved game to the author of
the AI. Only repeatable crashes are of any use.
