Crystal (19 July 2008) for cEvo 1.1.1
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Concept
=======
Sign treaties with other tribes to prevent
conflict and to fight common foes.
Trade knowledge to speed up advancement.


Recommendations
===============
Play on a map with at least 75% land mass: Crystal does not know boats.
Put the Crystal players at the lowest difficulty (1 bar).


Diplomacy
=========
Crystal trades 1 tech for 1 tech.
If you dont like diplomacy, you can reject contact.
Crystal will get upset and not contact you again.
If you want to make it happy again, you can give it
your civil report and next some technology.


Modifying Crystal settings
==========================
You can edit the file Crystal.ini to alter Crystal's behaviour.

For example, if you change the line "buildWonders=1" into
"buildWonders=0", Crystal wont't build any world wonders.

Most settings can only have the value 1 or 0.
1 means True/On
0 means False/Off

If you have messed up the Crystal.ini file,
you can delete it. A new file will be generated.

Regarding Crystal research:
Advances with a higher value are researched first.
The values are modified +1 or -1 during the game:
+1 : advance has been acquired by trade
-1 : advance can be acquired by trade (so delay research)
